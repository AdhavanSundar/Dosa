<body><h1>What is Dosa?</h1>

    <hr>

    <img src="Dosa-Recipe-3.jpg">
    
    <p>A dosa is a thin savory pancake in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black lentils and rice.
         Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar.
          Dosa is a signature dish in South India and Sri Lanka, and is popularly served in their respective restaurants around the world. </p></body>

          <h1>How does a Dosa Taste</h1>

          <hr>

          <p>As described, it's a thin, crisp crepe or pancake.
             It has a slight tangy taste due to the fermentation, and is savory rather than sweet.
              Without the filling, on its own it's called 'plain dosa' that can be eaten with a variety of vegetable curries.

             The accompaniments vary from state to state.
            </p>

            <h1>What To Eat It With</h1>

            <hr>
            
            <p>While coconut chutney, sambar, idli podi, and onion chutney are the popular side dishes for idli and dosa, there are many more regional-specific sides for the popular idli and dosa.


            </p>

            <h1>How to Eat Dosa</h1>

            <hr>

            <p>It's customary in Indian culture to eat dosa with your hands. 
                I like to tear it off and eat it in small bites.
                 If served with a dip or chutney, you can tear pieces off and dunk them into the dip or sauce before eating, or you can leave it whole and dip as you go!</p>

<h1>Why I Like It</h1>


<hr>

<p>Unlike Western breads that use yeast as a leavening agent or the unleavened wheat-based flatbreads of North India,
     the dosa batter is naturally fermented, making it light and very easy to digest. 
    This process also creates a distinctive sour taste, which makes the dosa delightfully moreish.</p>
